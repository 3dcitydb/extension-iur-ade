How to use
==========

1. Run the ADE Manager Plugin of the Importer/Exporter as described in the 3DCityDB online
documentation: https://3dcitydb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/release-v4.2.3/impexp/plugins/ade-manager.html

2. Transform the UrbanRevitalizationADE.xsd to a 3DCityDB schema extension as described here:
https://3dcitydb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/release-v4.2.3/impexp/plugins/ade-manager.html#ade-transformation

3. Register the i-UR ADE extension in your 3DCityDB instance based on the transformation result from step 2 as
described here: https://3dcitydb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/release-v4.2.3/impexp/plugins/ade-manager.html#registration-of-a-test-ade

Note: A pre-processed transformation result is provided in "resources/database". This allows you to skip steps 1 and
2 and to directly jump to step 3 to register the i-UR ADE extension in your 3DCityDB instance.
